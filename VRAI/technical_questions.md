What is the difference between == and __eq__ in Python?

>>  __eq__ is a special method (or "magic method") that defines the behavior of the == operator for a class.
By default, __eq__ compares the memory addresses of objects (i.e., checks if they are the same object in memory).
You can override __eq__ in a custom class to define equality based on specific attributes.


What is garbage collection in Python, and why is it needed?

Garbage collection in Python is the process of automatically managing memory by reclaiming unused memory and cleaning up objects that are no longer in use.
It ensures that memory occupied by objects that are no longer accessible is freed, preventing memory leaks.
