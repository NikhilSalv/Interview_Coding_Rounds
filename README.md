# Interview_Coding_Rounds

#### I've made it a habit to document every interview question I encounter, regardless of the outcome. 
#### Here's the documentation of all coding questions. Please find the soluion in this repositories. Question titles are same as file names.

- AWS_Q1.py :

Given an array of integers, create a 2-dimensional array where the first element is a distinct value from the array and the second element is that value's frequency within the array. Sort the resulting array descending by frequency. If multiple values have the same frequency, they should be sorted ascending.

- AWS_Q2.py :

Given a list of strings made up of the characters 'a' and 'b', 
create a regular expression that will
match strings that begin and end with the same
letter.

###### Example : 
'a', 'aa', and 'bababbb' match.
'ab'and 'baba' do not match.
