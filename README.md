# Interview_Coding_Rounds

#### I've made it a habit to document every interview question I encounter, regardless of the outcome. 
#### Here's the documentation of all coding questions. Please find the soluion in this repositories. Question titles are same as file names.


# Algorithmic Patterns and Use Cases

| **Pattern**                  | **Use Cases**                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Two Pointers**             | Sorted arrays, merging, pairs                |
| **Sliding Window**           | Subarrays, substrings, maximum/minimum       |
| **Hash Map (Dictionary)**    | Quick lookups, duplicates, counting          |
| **Prefix Sum / Difference Array** | Range sum queries                   |
| **Binary Search**            | Searching sorted arrays, monotonic functions |
| **Bit Manipulation**         | Unique elements, set bits                    |
| **Recursion & Backtracking** | Combinations, permutations, trees            |
| **Dynamic Programming (DP)** | Optimization, counting paths                 |
| **Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)** | Paths, cycles, connected components     |
| **Heap (Priority Queue)**    | Top K elements, scheduling                   |
| **Greedy Algorithms**        | Local to global optimization                 |
| **Tree Traversal**           | Hierarchical data structures                 |
